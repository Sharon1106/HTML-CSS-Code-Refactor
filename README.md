# HTML and CSS Code Refactor
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

For this project I read through existing html and css code to apply the right semantic elements for accesibility.  
Added alt to images  
Changed div tags to correct semantic elements(ie.header,nav,section,article,aside,footer)  
Changed id and classes to define what certain elements do,Links and images.  
Added alt attribute to all image elements.  
Made sure headers are in correct order.  
Added a descriptive title for elements
